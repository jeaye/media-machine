# media-machine
Here you'll find configs and a build script for a tailored, minimal Arch Linux
distribution; it contains essential files for movie watching and music listening
and is designed to run entirely from the ISO, with no installation.

## Building
To build this distro yourself, just run the `./build` script from an Arch
machine. [Archiso](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Archiso) is used for the
creation.
